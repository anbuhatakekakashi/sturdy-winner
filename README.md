Create your on branch and work off that. I have a general vision. But haven't had a chance to write it out yet. Any questions ask me. In general, write code that can work off both windows and linux. But if you can't write for both make it windows centered.

For testing you will need to have twitch account.

sturdy-winner currently is just a basic irc chat bot. Doesn't do much yet.
